<h2><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/while-loop-in-python/1">While loop in Python</a></h2><h3>Difficulty Level : Difficulty: Easy</h3><hr><div class="problems_problem_content__Xm_eO"><p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Congratulations!</strong> You are one more step close to Python Programming World. You are now familiar with <strong>if-elif-else</strong> in Python, and <strong>for</strong> loop in Python.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">While loop in Python is same as like in CPP and Java, but, here you have to use '<strong>:</strong>' to end while statement (used to end any statement). While loop is used to iterate same as for loop, except that in while loop you can customize jump of steps in coupling with variable used to loop, after every iteration, unlike in for loop (you cannot customize jump according to the variable you are using to loop through).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Let's get it more clearly through this question. Given a number <strong>x</strong>, the task is to print the numbers from x to 0 in <strong>decreasing order</strong> in a single line.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Example:</strong></span></p>

<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input:</strong>
x = 3
<strong>Output:
</strong>3 2 1 0</span>
<span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Explanation:</strong>
Numbers in decreasing order from 3
are 3, 2, 1, 0.</span></pre>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:18px">Your Task:</span></strong><br>
<span style="font-size:18px">This is a function problem. You need to complete the <strong>printInDecreasing()&nbsp;</strong>function and print the x from x to 0 in a single line.</span></p>
